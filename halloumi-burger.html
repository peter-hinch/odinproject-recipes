      <p>Struggle to find dishes to cook that take very little time but the whole family will love? Look no further than these chicken and halloumi burgers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 tbsp oil, plus extra for frying the halloumi, if needed</li>
      <li>4 tbsp piri-piri sauce or other mild chilli sauce, plus extra for drizzling</li>
      <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>burger buns, split in half</li>
      <li>250g block lighter halloumi, sliced into 8 pieces</li>
      <li>¼ small white cabbage, finely sliced</li>
      <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
      <li>4 tbsp hummus, tzatziki or soured cream & chive dip</li>
      <li>handful of rocket or 4-8 soft lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>2 large roasted red peppers from a jar, drained and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Put the chicken breasts between two pieces of baking parchment and bash with a rolling pin until 1cm thick. Cut each into two even pieces.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Heat two frying pans over a medium-high heat, heating the oil in one. Fry the chicken in the oiled pan for 3-4 mins on each side until cooked through. Season. Reduce the heat, drizzle in the chilli sauce and half the lemon juice and cook for 1-2 mins more until the sauce is reduced. Remove from the heat.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>While the chicken cooks, toast the buns in the dry frying pan for 30 secs. Transfer to a plate, then fry the halloumi in the pan (add a bit of oil if the pan is not non-stick) for 30 secs on each side until golden. Toss the cabbage with the mayo and remaining lemon juice.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Spoon the hummus (or dip of your choice) into the toasted buns, then top with the rocket, chilli chicken, halloumi and peppers. Drizzle with a little more chilli sauce, spoon over the cabbage, season with black pepper, and top with the bun lids. Serve with any extra cabbage on the side, or a green salad.</p>
