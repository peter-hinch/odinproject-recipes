      <p>Give hamburgers a healthy makeover by oven-cooking lean beef and serving with wholemeal bun and sweet potatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large, roundish sweet potatoes, cut into chunky chips</li>
      <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp chilli flakes, plus a pinch</li>
      <li>400g pack extra-lean beef mince</li>
      <li>1 onion, grated</li>
      <li>1 tbsp grated parmesan</li>
      <li>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</li>
      <li>4 small wholemeal buns, halved</li>
      <li>1 Little Gem lettuce, leaved separated</li>
      <li>1 beef tomato, sliced</li>
      <li>1 red onion, sliced (optional)</li>
      <li>4 pickles or gherkins, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Toss the chips with the oil, 1 tsp chilli flakes and some seasoning. Arrange in a single layer on a large baking tray and cook for about 30 mins, turning halfway through.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Put the mince, remaining chilli flakes, onion, Parmesan, tomato ketchup and lots of black pepper in a large bowl and mix to combine. Shape into 4 burgers. Ten mins before the chips are ready, put the burgers on a baking tray and bake for 10 mins until cooked through.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Top one half of the buns with the lettuce, tomato and onion. Add the burgers, then top with the roll tops. Serve with chips and pickles on the side.</p>
